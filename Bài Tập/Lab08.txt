Collections, I/O streams
In the class World, use a Collection instead of using array for entities.
Limit number of bullets to 10, count number of hit dragons. After shot 10 bullets end a game.
Define a class HighScore with attributes name and value. Create 10 scores in a source code on the beginning and add your score at the end. Store them in the OrderedSet (it is an interface and implementation is a class TreeSet) and order them by value of score descending. Print all high scores at the end.
Store and load high scores from text CSV file. Format will be that very row will contain <NAME>;<VALUE>.
