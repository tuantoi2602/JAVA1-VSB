Lab11:

Fill in the missing functionality in the pre-prepared project using Java SE8 Streams.
Tournament generation
    Generate a list of 10 random players using the stream and then filter so that it does not contain players with the same name
    Use the stream to generate a list of 50 matches between random players (from the list of players) with a random result. Make sure the player does not play with himself.

Tournament listing
    Use the stream to add a listing of all players to the builder. Individual players are separated by a "\ n" character
    Use the stream to add a listing of all entries to the builder. Individual matches are separated by a "\ n" character

Single player statistics
    Show the number of matches played by a given player (using Streams)
    Show the number of goals scored by a given player (help Streams)

Mutual statistics of two players
    List the matches played between the given players (using the stream)
    Show the number of matches played between the given players (using the stream)
    Show match with the largest total number (sum of both players) scored goals between relevant players (help Streams)

Serialize the tournament to a file
    Save the tournament to a file using object serialization.
    Load a serialized tournament from a file


In the PONG game, add the ability to save and load (to / from a file) the current state of the game (position and speed of objects - bats and ball, current score) using serialization.
